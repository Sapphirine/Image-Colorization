# Image-Colorization

Image Colorization contains the following files 

vgg16_mod.py - The model for the CNN that is trained for image colorization. 

preprocessing.m - handles the reading of the image set and conversion to the CIELAB colorspace before outputting the LAB channels and binned color vectors as the feature and class datasets.

image_color_elephas.py - loads and stores the .mat files into the hdf5 big data format. loads the CNN model and the Elephas module is then used to convert the hdf5 data to RDD format, which is then trained on to generate weights.


colorize.py - loads the feature vectors of our test set which is then colorized accordingly based on our previously generated weights and CNN model. The image is then exported in .mat format to be displayed using the visualization script. 

visualization.m - will unpack the CIELAB .mat file generated by the Python colorization script and output the colorized image in standard JPEG format.
